# Character-Adder-and-Remover
Used for Google Sheets.

NOTE: This is just my test run to see where I'm at in developing things.

With a built-in control panel for Google Sheets, you can add and remove characters from the main list!
Not only that, you can also create characters to fill in their stats and add them when you're ready!

Google Sheets Template will be provided soon. Hopefully not for long.
